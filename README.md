### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Cosmos\ Music\ Player
   ```

2. **Configure iCloud**
   - Ensure your Apple Developer Account has iCloud capabilities
   - The app uses container: `iCloud.dev.neofx.music-player`
   - Update the bundle identifier in project settings if needed

3. **Build and Run**
   - Open `Cosmos Music Player.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Select your development team
   - Build and run on device (required for iCloud functionality)

### First Launch Setup

1. **iCloud Sign-in** (Optional): Sign into iCloud only if you want cross-device sync
2. **Add Music**: Choose your preferred storage method:
   - **iCloud Drive**: Place music files in "iCloud Drive → Cosmos Music Player" folder
   - **Local Storage**: Place music files in "On My iPhone → Cosmos Music Player" folder
3. **Library Sync**: The app will automatically detect and index your music from both locations
4. **Enjoy**: Start creating playlists and exploring your music!

## Usage Guide 📱

### Adding Music

You have two storage options:

#### Option 1: iCloud Drive (Syncs Across Devices)
1. Open Files app on your iOS device
2. Navigate to "iCloud Drive" → "Cosmos Music Player"
3. Add your FLAC, MP3, or WAV music files to this folder
4. Files will sync to all your devices signed into the same iCloud account

#### Option 2: Local Storage (This Device Only)
1. Open Files app on your iOS device
2. Navigate to "On My iPhone" → "Cosmos Music Player"
3. Add your FLAC, MP3, or WAV music files to this folder
4. Files remain on this device only (no iCloud required)

**Mixed Storage**: You can use both methods simultaneously - the app will find and index music from both locations!

### Using the Graphic Equalizer
1. **Access EQ**: Tap the equalizer icon in the now playing screen
2. **Enter GraphicEQ Text**: Input your GraphicEQ settings in text format
3. **Apply Settings**: Save your custom GraphicEQ configuration
4. **Multiple Configurations**: Create and switch between different GraphicEQ settings
5. **Toggle On/Off**: Enable or disable the equalizer without losing your settings

GraphicEQ format allows you to define frequency-specific gain adjustments for precise audio control.

### Creating Playlists
1. Tap the "+" button in the Playlists section
2. Enter a playlist name
3. Add songs from your library
4. Playlists sync automatically across devices

### Using Siri Voice Control
1. **Enable Siri**: Ensure Siri is enabled in your device settings
2. **Grant Permissions**: Allow Siri access to Cosmos Music Player when prompted
3. **Voice Commands**: Use any of the supported commands listed above
4. **Language Support**: Works with both English and French Siri
5. **Smart Matching**: Don't worry about exact pronunciation - the app uses fuzzy matching for names

### Language Settings
The app automatically uses your device's language setting. Currently supported:
- English (en)
- French (fr)

## Dependencies 📦

### Swift Packages

## Security & Privacy 🔒

- **Flexible Storage**: Music files stored either locally on device or in user's personal iCloud Drive
- **User Choice**: Complete control over where music files are stored (local vs cloud)
- **No Tracking**: No user data collection or tracking
- **Offline First**: Full functionality works without internet (especially with local storage)

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues

**Music not appearing:**
- For iCloud files: Check iCloud Drive is enabled and signed in
- For local files: Ensure files are in the local "Cosmos Music Player" folder
- Verify files are FLAC, MP3, or WAV format
- Try manual sync from the app
- Check both iCloud Drive and "On My iPhone" locations

**Equalizer not working:**
- Ensure the equalizer is enabled (toggle on)
- Check that audio output is not externally limited (headphone safety, volume limits)
- Try resetting to a preset before applying custom settings
- Restart playback if changes don't apply immediately

**Playlist sync issues:**
- Ensure iCloud Drive has sufficient storage
- Check device is connected to internet
- Try signing out and back into iCloud

**Siri not working:**
- Ensure Siri is enabled in Settings → Siri & Search
- Grant Siri access to Cosmos Music Player when prompted
- Try saying "Cosmos" or "Cosmos Musique" (French) to help Siri recognize the app
- Restart the app to refresh Siri vocabulary
- Make sure you're connected to the internet for initial Siri setup
